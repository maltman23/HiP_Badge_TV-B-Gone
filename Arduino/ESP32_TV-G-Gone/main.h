TV-B-Gone main.h for Arduino version 0.002

  The original TV-B-Gone kit firmware is:
  TV-B-Gone Firmware version 1.2
       for use with ATtiny85v and TV-B-Gone kit v1.2 hardware

  Updated definitions for
       const struct IrCode *EUpowerCodes[] = {
  and
       const struct IrCode *NApowerCodes[] = {
  so that the sketch will compile with Arduino 1.6.5 software.
  The new definitions are:
       extern "C" const struct IrCode * const EUpowerCodes[] = {
  and
       extern "C" const struct IrCode * const EUpowerCodes[] = {

  The Off-Codes here are the same as the original compressed codes
       except the indices to the On-Time/Off-Time pairs table for each Off-Code are no longer data-compressed.
  The "convertWorldCodes.py" script converts from the original to the new version of the Off-Codes in the "extractedWorldCodeData.json" file

  Updated for ESP32-C3 and new TV-B-Gone kit format of POWER-Code database.
  I'm having trouble getting the ESP32-C3 compiler for Arduino to accept variable pointers to constants 
     (even through the same code compiles fine, and works fine, when compiled for Arduino Uno boards),
  The code compiles and works fine if the entire database here ( struct IrCode {} ) and in WORLDcodes.cpp is variables (and not constants).

/*
This sketch was originally written for an Arduino board, and Arduino boards, using AVR chips,
for which the compiler transfers constants to RAM.  To keep the constants in program memory, PROGMEM was used, along with
   pgm_read_byte()
      and
   pgm_read_word()
to access the constants.
For ESP chips, there is no need for PROGMEM, since constants are kept in program memory.
To replace all occurances of
   pgm_read_byte()
	  and
   pgm_read_word()
we make use of the following macros
