Updated definition for 
     struct IrCode {
so that the sketch will compile with Arduino 1.6.5 software.
Also: add conditional define for changing DELAY_CNT, 
      since the new Arduino software compiles to make the delay_ten_us() function execute too quickly.

/*
This sketch was originally written for an Arduino board, and Arduino boards, using AVR chips,
transfer constants to RAM.  To keep the constants in program memory, PROGMEM was used, along with
   pgm_read_byte()
      and
   pgm_read_word()
to access the constants.
For ESP chips, there is no need for PROGMEM, since constants are kept in program memory.
To replace all occurances of
   pgm_read_byte()
	  and
   pgm_read_word()
we make use of the following define statements
*/
#define pgm_read_byte(addr) (*(const unsigned char *)(addr))
#define pgm_read_word(addr) (*(const unsigned short *)(addr))


// The TV-B-Gone for Arduino can use
//   either the EU or the NA database of POWER CODES
// EU is for Europe, Middle East, Australia, New Zealand, and some countries in Africa and South America
// NA is for North America, Asia, and the rest of the world not covered by EU

// Two regions!
#define NA 1
#define EU 0

// What pins do what
#define DBG 12
#define LED 13
#define IRLED 3
#define TRIGGER 2
#define REGIONSWITCH 5  // add a 1K pull-down resistor from Pin 5 to ground for EU (blank for NA)

// Lets us calculate the size of the NA/EU databases
#define NUM_ELEM(x) (sizeof (x) / sizeof (*(x)));

// set define to 0 to turn off debug output
#define DEBUG 0
#define DEBUGP(x) if (DEBUG == 1) { x ; }

// Shortcut to insert single, non-optimized-out nop
#define NOP __asm__ __volatile__ ("nop")

// Arduino software that is newer than V1.0 needs a different value for DELAY_CNT
// set ARD_VER_10X to 1 for Arduino software V1.0.x
// set ARD_VER to 0 for newer versions of Arduino software (such as V1.6.5)
#define ARD_VER_10X 0

// DELAY_CNT is used for delay_ten_us() for timing ontime and offtime values
// Tweak this if neccessary to change timing for accuracy (which must be done empirically)
#if ARD_VER_10X
# define DELAY_CNT 25
#else
# define DELAY_CNT 30
#endif

// programmed in terms of 'periods' not 'freqs' - that
// is, the inverse!
